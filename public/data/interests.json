  "Apart from being a software developer, I enjoy spending time outdoors â€” taking walks, visiting new places, and exploring nature whenever I get the chance.",
  "When indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, enjoy watching cricket, love cooking, and often dive into learning about the latest advancements in the backend development world."
